This paper presents two empirical studies in which groups of raters (n1 = 3, n2 = 9) assessed the methodological rigor of research papers (k1 = 52, k2 = 110) using detailed catalogs of relatively well-defined quality criteria. The main endpoint in both studies was inter-rater reliability, which is a necessary prerequisite for any subsequent use of such assessments (e.g., as part of hiring or promotion procedures). Both studies showed that the application of several open science practices (e.g., open data, preregistration) may in fact be assessed with good reliability (Kappa &gt; .60, ICCs &gt; .75), even by raters who received little to no training, and within reasonable amounts of time (M1 = 21.7, M2 = 40.2 minutes on average). When aggregated across indicators, inter-rater reliability for this type of assessment was good to excellent (Study 1: ICC(1, 1) = .91, Study 2: ICC(1,1) = .74). A subsample of papers in Study 2 was drawn randomly from the recent literature (2020-2022) and showed that typical papers in contemporary psychology still espouse very low methodological rigor. Study 2 also showed that criteria related to consensus-building do not yet espouse sufficient reliability. Standard criterion sets for assessing the methodological rigor of empirical research should be used more widely in evaluating submissions to scientific journals, as well as published research (e.g., in evaluating the research productivity of individuals, groups or institutions). Such evaluations will be also facilitated by establishing clearer and more widely-adopted reporting standards.\n              \n            \n \n            \nThe OpenLAV video database for affect induction: Analyzing the uniformity of video stimuli effectsIsrael L, Paukner P, Schiestel L, Diepold K & Schönbrodt F (2021).  https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/vhmbq \n                Abstract\n             PDF\n\n\nVaried emotions spark - Uniformity sought within - Personality's sway\n\n            \n              \n                ×\n                Abstract\n                The Open Library for Affective Videos (OpenLAV) is a new video database for experimental emotion induction. The 188 videos (mean duration: 40 s; range: 12–71 s) have a CC-BY license. Ratings for valence, arousal, several appraisals, and emotion labels were assessed from 434 US-American participants in an online study (on average 70 ratings per video), along with personality traits from the raters (Big 5 personality dimensions and several motive dispositions). The OpenLAV is able to induce a large variety of different emotions, but the videos vary in uniformity of emotion induction. Based on different variability metrics, we recommend videos for the most uniform induction of different emotions. Moreover, the predictive power of personality traits on emotion ratings was analyzed using a machine-learning approach. In contrast to previous research, no effects of personality on the emotional experience were found.\n              \n            \n \n            \nGenug ist genug: Unethisches Verhalten in der Wissenschaft muss endlich systematisch angegangen werden!Leising D, Dshemuchadse M, Schönbrodt F & Scherbaum S (2021).  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5126637 \n                Abstract\n             PDF\n\n\nScientists with shame - Enough is enough, now speak - Truth to silence dark\n\n            \n              \n                ×\n                Abstract\n                NA\n              \n            \n \n            \nTesting fit patterns with polynomial regression modelsSchönbrodt F (2016).  https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/ndggf \n                Abstract\n             PDF\n\n\nPattern in the code - Congruent, yet scales apart - Math's gentle persuasion\n\n            \n              \n                ×\n                Abstract\n                Fit hypotheses, also labeled ‘congruence’, ‘discrepancy’, or ‘congruity’ hypotheses, contain the notion that an outcome is optimal when two predictor variables match well, while incongruent/discrepant combinations of the predictors lead to a suboptimal outcome. Previous statistical frameworks for analyzing fit hypotheses emphasized the necessity of commensurable scales, which means that both predictors must be measured on the same content dimension and on the same numerical scale. In some research areas, however, it is impossible to achieve scale equivalence, because the predictors have to be measured with different methods, such as explicit attitudes (e.g., questionnaires) and implicit attitudes (e.g., reaction time task). In this paper, I differentiate numerical congruence from fit patterns, a concept that does not depend on the notion of commensurability, and hence can be applied to fit hypotheses with incommensurable scales. Polynomial regression can be used to test for the presence of a fit pattern in empirical data. I propose several new regression models for testing fit patterns which are statistically simpler and conceptually more meaningful than a full polynomial model. An R package is introduced which provides user-friendly functions for the computation, visualization, and model comparison of several fit patterns. An empirical example on implicit/explicit motive fit demonstrates the usage of the new methods.\n              \n            \n \n\n2025\n\n \n            \nInterpersonal versus intrapersonal emotion regulation: Intensity of negative emotion predicts usage probability.Claus N, Flechsenhar A, Motka F, Sckopke P, Schönbrodt F, Stefan A, Werner G, Cludius B & Zygar‐Hoffmann C (2025).

Previous studies have focused primarily on intrapersonal ER. In contrast, everyday use of interpersonal ER remains understudied, with the association between perceived emotional intensity and selection of intra- or intrinsic interpersonal ER still unclear. In a preregistered study, we used experience sampling method data from a community sample of individuals in a heterosexual relationship (n = 183) who provided reports on their daily lives over a period of 4 weeks during the first COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. Surveys included questions about various emotions, their perceived intensity, and selected ER strategies. Results revealed more frequent use of ER overall with increasing emotional intensity of all negative emotions (except for boredom). In line with our hypothesis, results showed that greater emotional intensity increased the probability of interpersonal ER more strongly than intrapersonal ER for most negative emotions, in both women and men. Additionally, we found that men used significantly more intrapersonal than interpersonal strategies at average emotional intensity of all negative emotions. A preference for interpersonal ER in the face of highly intense emotions may be related to a higher demand for resources, which is compensated through social connection. In the association between perceived emotional intensity and ER selection, our research highlights the importance of considering both intra- and interpersonal ER strategies.

Such congruence hypotheses can be tested with response surface analysis (RSA), in which a second-order polynomial regression model is estimated and suitably interpreted. Whereas several strategies exist for this interpretation, they all contain rationales that diminish the probability of drawing correct conclusions. For example, a frequently applied strategy involves calculating six auxiliary parameters from the estimated regression weights and accepting the congruence hypothesis if they satisfy certain conditions. In testing the conditions, a nonsignificant null-hypothesis test of some parameters is taken as evidence that the parameter is zero. This interpretation is formally inadmissible and adversely affects the probability of making correct decisions about the congruence hypothesis. We address this limitation of the six-parameter strategy and other RSA strategies by proposing that statistical equivalence testing (SET) be integrated into RSA. We compare the existing and new RSA strategies with a simulation study and find that the SET strategies are sensible alternatives to the existing strategies. We provide code templates for implementing the SET strategies.

The best theories motivate us to search for discoveries, guide us towards successful interventions, and help us to explain and organize knowledge. Such theories require a high degree of specificity, which in turn requires formal modeling. Yet, in psychological science, many theories are not precise and psychological scientists often lack the technical skills to formally specify existing theories. This problem raises the question: How can we promote formal theory development in psychology, where there are many content experts but few modelers? In this paper, we discuss one strategy for addressing this issue: a Many Modelers approach. Many Modelers consists of mixed teams of modelers and non-modelers that collaborate to create a formal theory of a phenomenon. Here, we report a proof of concept of this approach, which we piloted as a three-hour hackathon at the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science conference in 2021. After surveying the participants, results suggest that (a) psychologists who have never developed a formal model can become (more) excited about formal modeling + and theorizing; (b) a division of labor in formal theorizing is possible where only one or a few team members possess the prerequisite modeling expertise; and (c) first working prototypes of a theoretical model can be created in a short period of time. These results show some promise for the many modelers approach as a team science tool for theory development.\n              \n            \n \n\n2024\n\n \n            \nThe reflection of motive dispositions in everyday agentic motivational states.Zygar‐Hoffmann C, Hagemeyer B & Schönbrodt F (2024).

Here, we propose ways to overcome the social dilemma underlying the decades of inaction. Any solution needs to not only resolve the current problems but also be capable of preventing takeover by corporations: it needs to replace traditional journals with a decentralized, resilient, evolvable network that is interconnected by open standards and open-source norms under the governance of the scholarly community. It needs to replace the monopolies connected to journals with a genuine, functioning and well-regulated market. In this new market, substitutable service providers compete and innovate according to the conditions of the scholarly community, avoiding sustained vendor lock-in. Therefore, a standards body needs to form under the governance of the scholarly community to allow the development of open scholarly infrastructures servicing the entire research workflow. We propose a redirection of money from legacy publishers to the new network by funding bodies broadening their minimal infrastructure requirements at recipient institutions to include modern infrastructure components replacing and complementing journal functionalities. Such updated eligibility criteria by funding agencies would help realign the financial incentives for recipient institutions with public and scholarly interest.\n              \n            \n \n            \nEmpfehlungen zur Bewertung wissenschaftlicher Leistungen bei Berufungsverfahren in der PsychologieGärtner A, Leising D & Schönbrodt F (2023).

Impact-Faktoren von Zeitschriften, h-Index) werden kritisiert, weil (a) empirische Studien ihre Validität in Frage stellen und sie (b) eine Kultur zu fördern scheinen, die der reinen Quantität Vorrang gegenüber der inhaltlichen Qualität der Forschung gibt. Der Ruf nach spezifischen, besseren Alternativen zu den derzeit gängigen Leistungsindikatoren wird immer lauter. Die Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychologie hat nach der Unterzeichnung von DORA und dem Beitritt zu CoARA eine Arbeitsgruppe mit der Frage befasst, wie eine verantwortungsvollere Form der Forschungsbewertung für die Psychologie aussehen könnte. Über den aktuellen Stand dieser Überlegungen berichten wir hier: Konkret schlagen wir ein zweistufiges Bewertungsverfahren vor, das die Objektivität und Effizienz metrischer Indikatoren (Phase 1) mit einer vertieften, diskursiven Bewertung spezifischer Forschungsinhalte verbindet (Phase 2) verbindet. Wir plädieren für eine Ausweitung des Spektrums relevanter Forschungsbeiträge und schlagen Qualitätskriterien für Forschungsartikel, Datensätze und Forschungssoftware vor, welche vor allem deren methodische Stringenz erfassen. Anhand dieser Kriterien wird in der ersten Phase des Bewertungsprozesses ermittelt, ob eine Mindestschwelle für methodische Stringenz erreicht wird, die Kandidat:innen erfüllen müssen, um für eine Einstellung oder Beförderung in Frage zu kommen. Im Gegensatz dazu sollen in der zweiten Phase des Beurteilungsprozesses Metriken keine Rolle mehr spielen, sondern die spezifischen Inhalte der Forschungsarbeiten der Kandidat:innen im Fokus einer vertieften Diskussion stehen. Wir stellen konkrete Erhebungsinstrumente bereit, die zum Teil bereits in der Praxis erprobt wurden. Unser Ziel ist es, eine breite Diskussion über das Thema anzuregen und letztlich dazu beizutragen, dass die Bedeutung der wissenschaftlichen Qualität im Rahmen von Berufungsverfahren spürbar gestärkt wird.\n              \n            \n \n            \nComparing the vibration of effects due to model, data pre-processing and sampling uncertainty on a large data set in personality psychologyKlau S, Felix F, Patel C, Ioannidis J, Boulesteix A & Hoffmann S (2023).

If combined with selective reporting and pressure to publish, this flexibility can have devastating consequences on the validity of research findings. We extend the recently proposed vibration of effects approach to provide a framework comparing three main sources of uncertainty which lead to instability in empirical findings, namely data pre-processing, model, and sampling uncertainty. We analyze the behavior of these sources for varying sample sizes for two associations in personality psychology. Through the joint investigation of model and data pre-processing vibration, we can compare the relative impact of these two types of uncertainty and identify the most influential analytical choices. While all types of vibration show a decrease for increasing sample sizes, data pre-processing and model vibration remain non-negligible, even for a sample of over 80000 participants. The increasing availability of large data sets that are not initially recorded for research purposes can make data pre-processing and model choices very influential. We therefore recommend the framework as a tool for transparent reporting of the stability of research findings.\n              \n            \n \n            \nMachine Learning and Risk Assessment: Random Forest Does Not Outperform Logistic Regression in the Prediction of Sexual RecidivismEtzler S, Schönbrodt F, Pargent F, Eher R & Rettenberger M (2023).

One of the most prominent questionable research practices is p -hacking. Typically, p -hacking is defined as a compound of strategies targeted at rendering non-significant hypothesis testing results significant. However, a comprehensive overview of these p -hacking strategies is missing, and current meta-scientific research often ignores the heterogeneity of strategies. Here, we compile a list of 12 p -hacking strategies based on an extensive literature review, identify factors that control their level of severity, and demonstrate their impact on false-positive rates using simulation studies. We also use our simulation results to evaluate several approaches that have been proposed to mitigate the influence of questionable research practices. Our results show that investigating p -hacking at the level of strategies can provide a better understanding of the process of p -hacking, as well as a broader basis for developing effective countermeasures. By making our analyses available through a Shiny app and R package, we facilitate future meta-scientific research aimed at investigating the ramifications of p -hacking across multiple strategies, and we hope to start a broader discussion about different manifestations of p -hacking in practice.\n              \n            \n \n            \nReplication of the natural selection of bad scienceKohrt F, Smaldino P, McElreath R & Schönbrodt F (2023).

Multiple initiatives call for developing alternatives to existing metrics that better reflect quality (instead of quantity) in research assessment. This report, written by a task force established by the German Psychological Society, proposes how responsible research assessment could be done in the field of psychology. We present four principles of responsible research assessment in hiring and promotion and suggest a two-phase assessment procedure that combines the objectivity and efficiency of indicators with a qualitative, discursive assessment of shortlisted candidates. The main aspects of our proposal are (a) to broaden the range of relevant research contributions to include published data sets and research software, along with research papers, and (b) to place greater emphasis on quality and rigor in research evaluation.\n              \n            \n \n            \nResponsible Research Assessment II: A specific proposal for hiring and promotion in psychologyGärtner A, Leising D, Freyer N, Musfeld P, Lange J & Schönbrodt F (2022).

There is now a wide-spread demand for viable alternatives to current academic evaluation practices. In a previous report, we laid out four basic principles of a more responsible research assessment in academic hiring and promotion processes (Schönbrodt et al., 2024). The present paper offers a specific proposal for how these principles may be implemented in practice: We argue in favor of broadening the range of relevant research contributions and propose a set of concrete quality criteria (including a ready-to-use online tool) for research articles. These criteria are supposed to be used primarily in the first phase of the assessment process. Their function is to help establish a minimum threshold of methodological rigor – including empirical rigor and theoretical rigor – that candidates need to pass in order to be further considered for hiring or promotion. In contrast, the second phase of the assessment process focuses more on the actual content of candidates’ research output and necessarily uses more narrative means of assessment. The debate over ways of replacing current invalid evaluation criteria with ones that relate more closely to scientific quality continues. Its course and outcome will depend on the willingness of researchers to get involved and help shape it.\n              \n            \n \n            \nDemonstration of a ‘leapfrog’ randomized controlled trial as a method to accelerate the development and optimization of psychological interventionsBlackwell S, Schönbrodt F, Woud M, Wannemüller A, Bektas B, Rodrigues M, Hirdes J, Stumpp M & Margraf J (2022).

The 'leapfrog' trial design is a newly-developed simple Bayesian adaptive trial design with potential to accelerate treatment development. A first leapfrog trial was conducted to provide a demonstration and test feasibility, applying the method to a low-intensity internet-delivered intervention targeting anhedonia.At the start of this online, single-blind leapfrog trial, participants self-reporting depression were randomized to an initial control arm comprising four weeks of weekly questionnaires, or one of two versions of a four-week cognitive training intervention, imagery cognitive bias modification (imagery CBM). Intervention arms were compared to control on an ongoing basis via sequential Bayesian analyses, based on a primary outcome of anhedonia at post-intervention. Results were used to eliminate and replace arms, or to promote them to become the control condition based on pre-specified Bayes factor and sample size thresholds. Two further intervention arms (variants of imagery CBM) were added into the trial as it progressed.N = 188 participants were randomized across the five trial arms. The leapfrog methodology was successfully implemented to identify a 'winning' version of the imagery CBM, i.e. the version most successful in reducing anhedonia, following sequential elimination of the other arms.The study demonstrates feasibility of the leapfrog design and provides a foundation for its adoption as a method to accelerate treatment development in mental health.

That is, CRA indicates whether, in a set of empirical data, people with higher values on the directed discrepancy self-view S minus reality criterion R (i.e., S-R) tend to have higher values on some outcome variable (e.g., happiness). In a critical comment, Fiedler (2021) claims that CRA yields inaccurate conclusions in data with a suppressor effect. Here, we show that Fiedler's critique is unwarranted. All data that are simulated in his comment show a positive association between S-R and H, which is accurately detected by CRA. By construction, CRA indicates an association between S-R and H only when it is present in the data. In contrast to Fiedler's claim, it also yields valid conclusions when the outcome variable is related only to the self-view or when there is a suppressor effect. Our clarifications provide guidance for evaluating Fiedler's comment, clear up with the common heuristic that suppressor effects are always problematic, and assist readers in fully understanding CRA.

However, up to now, most studies have used cross-sectional data, and the prolonged impact of insomnia symptoms during the pandemic on later mental health remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated insomnia symptoms as a predictor of other aspects of mental health across 6 months, with altogether seven assessments (every 30 days, t0-t6), in a community sample (N = 166-267). Results showed no mean-level increase of insomnia symptoms and/or deterioration of mental health between baseline assessment (t0) and the 6- month follow-up (t6). As preregistered, higher insomnia symptoms (between persons) across all time points predicted reduced mental health at the 6-month follow-up. Interestingly, contrary to our hypothesis, higher insomnia symptoms at 1 month, within each person (i.e., compared to that person's symptoms at other time points), predicted improved rather than reduced aspects of mental health 1 month later. Hence, we replicated the predictive effect of averagely increased insomnia symptoms on impaired later mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we were surprised that increased insomnia symptoms at 1 month predicted aspects of improved mental health 1 month later. This unexpected effect might be specific for our study population and a consequence of our study design. Overall, increased insomnia symptoms may have served as a signal to engage in, and successfully implement, targeted countermeasures, which led to better short-term mental health in this healthy sample.\n              \n            \n \n            \nMotivational Interdependence in Couple RelationshipsPusch S, Schönbrodt F, Zygar‐Hoffmann C & Hagemeyer B (2022).

Based on theoretical tenets in motivation psychology, personality psychology, and research on interpersonal perception, the MIC model postulates that two partners' motive dispositions fundamentally interact in shaping their individual motivation and behavior. On a functional level, a partner's motivated behavior is conceptualized as an environmental cue that can contribute to an actor's motive expression and satisfaction. However, the partner's motivated behavior is considered to gain this motivational relevance only via the actor's subjective perception. Multilevel analyses of an extensive experience sampling study on partner-related communal motivation ( N = up to 60,803 surveys from 508 individuals nested in 258 couples) supported the MIC model. Participants, particularly those with strong communal motive dispositions, behaved more communally at moments when they perceived their partners to behave more communally. In addition, participants experienced momentary boosts in satisfaction when they behaved more communally and, at the same time, perceived their partners' behavior as similarly communal. Broader implications of the MIC model for research on romantic relationships are discussed.\n              \n            \n \n            \nTen steps toward a better personality science – how quality may be rewarded more in research evaluationLeising D, Thielmann I, Glöckner A, Gärtner A & Schönbrodt F (2022).

We point out ten steps that we think will go a long way in improving personality science. The first five steps focus on fostering consensus regarding (1) research goals, (2) terminology, (3) measurement practices, (4) data handling, and (5) the current state of theory and evidence. The other five steps focus on improving the credibility of empirical research, through (6) formal modelling, (7) mandatory pre-registration for confirmatory claims, (8) replication as a routine practice, (9) planning for informative studies (e.g., in terms of statistical power), and (10) making data, analysis scripts, and materials openly available. The current, quantity-based incentive structure in academia clearly stands in the way of implementing many of these practices, resulting in a research literature with sometimes questionable utility and/or integrity. As a solution, we propose a more quality-based reward scheme that explicitly weights published research by its Good Science merits.

As soon as sufficient information has been obtained, data collection is terminated. Here, we compare two sequential hypothesis testing procedures that have recently been proposed for use in psychological research: Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT; Psychological Methods, 25(2), 206-226, 2020) and the Sequential Bayes Factor Test (SBFT; Psychological Methods, 22(2), 322-339, 2017). We show that although the two methods have different philosophical roots, they share many similarities and can even be mathematically regarded as two instances of an overarching hypothesis testing framework. We demonstrate that the two methods use the same mechanisms for evidence monitoring and error control, and that differences in efficiency between the methods depend on the exact specification of the statistical models involved, as well as on the population truth. Our simulations indicate that when deciding on a sequential design within a unified sequential testing framework, researchers need to balance the needs of test efficiency, robustness against model misspecification, and appropriate uncertainty quantification. We provide guidance for navigating these design decisions based on individual preferences and simulation-based design analyses.\n              \n            \n \n            \nEliciting Short-Term Closeness in Couple Relationships With Ecological Momentary InterventionsZygar‐Hoffmann C, Cristoforo L, Wolf L & Schönbrodt F (2022).

The current study evaluates four micro-interventions for their suitability to experimentally elicit feelings of closeness towards one’s partner. Using participants’ smartphones, and a combination of experience sampling, event sampling, and ecological momentary interventions, individuals reported for a week on their experiences of closeness before and after completing daily either a neutral task or a task meant to enhance relationship closeness. The closeness tasks included showing physical affection, sharing a childhood memory, looking each other in the eyes for five minutes, and discussing shared life achievements. Results of intention-to-treat analyses on a within-person level showed that closeness increased from pre- to post-measurement on average more strongly on days of any of the four examined closeness conditions than on days of the neutral control conditions. Interindividual variability of this effect was observed, emphasizing the relevance of using within-person designs to evaluate such interventions. Exploratory analyses showed that effect sizes declined across time within the day. This study provides instruments for research on causal effects of closeness in everyday relationship life, and an evidence basis for smartphone-delivered interventions in practitioner settings.\n              \n            \n \n\n2021\n\n \n            \nMeasuring motivational relationship processes in experience sampling: A reliability model for moments, days, and persons nested in couplesSchönbrodt F, Zygar‐Hoffmann C, Nestler S, Pusch S & Hagemeyer B (2021).

In this paper, we focus on dyadic intensive longitudinal designs where both partners of a couple are assessed multiple times each day across several days. We introduce a statistical model for variance decomposition based on generalizability theory (extending P. E. Shrout & S. P. Lane, 2012), which can estimate the relative proportion of variability on four hierarchical levels: moments within a day, days, persons, and couples. Based on these variance estimates, four reliability coefficients are derived: between-couples, between-persons, within-persons/between-days, and within-persons/between-moments. We apply the model to two dyadic intensive experience sampling studies ( n 1 = 130 persons, 5 surveys each day for 14 days, ≥ 7508 unique surveys; n 2 = 508 persons, 5 surveys each day for 28 days, ≥ 47764 unique surveys). Five different scales in the domain of motivational processes and relationship quality were assessed with 2 to 5 items: State relationship satisfaction, communal motivation, and agentic motivation; the latter consists of two subscales, namely power and independence motivation. Largest variance components were on the level of persons, moments, couples, and days, where within-day variance was generally larger than between-day variance. Reliabilities ranged from .32 to .76 (couple level), .93 to .98 (person level), .61 to .88 (day level), and .28 to .72 (moment level). Scale intercorrelations reveal differential structures between and within persons, which has consequences for theory building and statistical modeling.\n              \n            \n \n            \nReplicability, Robustness, and Reproducibility in Psychological ScienceNosek B, Hardwicke T, Moshontz H, Allard A, Corker K, Dreber A, Fidler F, Hilgard J, Struhl M, Nuijten M, Rohrer J, Romero F, Scheel A, Scherer L, Schönbrodt F & Vazire S (2021).

Achieving replicability is important for making research progress. If findings are not replicable, then prediction and theory development are stifled. If findings are replicable, then interrogation of their meaning and validity can advance knowledge. Assessing replicability can be productive for generating and testing hypotheses by actively confronting current understandings to identify weaknesses and spur innovation. For psychology, the 2010s might be characterized as a decade of active confrontation. Systematic and multi-site replication projects assessed current understandings and observed surprising failures to replicate many published findings. Replication efforts highlighted sociocultural challenges such as disincentives to conduct replications and a tendency to frame replication as a personal attack rather than a healthy scientific practice, and they raised awareness that replication contributes to self-correction. Nevertheless, innovation in doing and understanding replication and its cousins, reproducibility and robustness, has positioned psychology to improve research practices and accelerate progress.\n              \n            \n \n            \nOpen Library for Affective Videos (OpenLAV)Israel L, Paukner P, Schiestel L, Diepold K & Schönbrodt F (2021).

New simulations raised the question whether these results are reliable revealing that using meta‐analytic methods on biased datasets lead to false‐positive rates of up to 100%. By assessing the performance of and applying different bias‐correcting meta‐analytic methods on a set of 71 studies we aimed for more precise effect size estimates. According to the sole bias‐correcting meta‐analytic method that performed well under a priori specified boundary conditions, CBCA and RM distinguished between experience‐based and fabricated statements. However, great heterogeneity limited precise point estimation (i.e., moderate to large effects). In contrast, Scientific Content Analysis (SCAN)—another content‐based technique tested—failed to discriminate between truth and lies. It is discussed how the gap between research on and forensic application of content‐based credibility assessment may be narrowed.\n              \n            \n \n            \nCubic response surface analysis: Investigating asymmetric and level-dependent congruence effects with third-order polynomial models.Humberg S, Schönbrodt F, Back M & Nestler S (2020).

They refer to, for example, the consequences of person-environment fit, similarity, or self-other agreement. For example, are people psychologically better adjusted when their self-view is in line with their reputation? A valid statistical approach that can be applied to investigate congruence hypotheses of this kind is quadratic Response Surface Analysis (RSA) in which a second-order polynomial model is fit to the data and appropriately interpreted. However, quadratic RSA does not allow researchers to investigate more precise expectations about a congruence effect. Do the data support an asymmetric congruence effect, in the sense that congruence leads to the highest (or lowest) outcome, but incongruence in one direction (e.g., self-view exceeds reputation) affects the outcome differently than incongruence in the other direction (e.g., self-view falls behind reputation)? Is there a level-dependent congruence effect, such that the amount of congruence is more strongly related to the outcome variable for some levels of the predictors (e.g., high self-view and reputation) than for others (e.g., low self-view and reputation)? Such complex congruence hypotheses have frequently been suggested in the literature, but they could not be investigated because an appropriate statistical approach has yet to be developed. Here, we present analytical strategies, based on third-order polynomial models, that enable users to investigate asymmetric and level-dependent congruence effects, respectively. To facilitate the correct application of the suggested approaches, we provide respective step-by-step guidelines, corresponding R syntax, and illustrative analyses using simulated and real data.

Forschende sollten sich daher bemühen, die sogenannten FAIR-Prinzipien zu erfüllen, d.h. Forschungsdaten sollten auffindbar, zugänglich, interoperabel und wiederverwendbar sein. Ein systematisches Forschungsdatenmanagement unterstützt diese Ziele und soll es gleichzeitig ermöglichen, diese effizient zu verwirklichen. Mit den vorliegenden überarbeiteten Empfehlungen zum Management und zur Bereitstellung von Forschungsdaten spezifiziert die Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychologie (DGPs) wichtige grundlegende Prinzipien des Datenmanagements in der Psychologie und greift hierbei auch Rückmeldungen der DGPs-Mitglieder auf, die im Rahmen einer Umfrage aus dem Jahr 2018 gewonnen wurden. In einem ersten Schritt werden auf Basis disziplinspezifischer Definitionen von Roh-, Primär-, Sekundär- und Metadaten Empfehlungen hinsichtlich des Verarbeitungsgrades der im Rahmen einer Datenveröffentlichung bereitzustellenden Daten gegeben. In der Folge werden datenschutz- sowie urheber- und nutzungsrechtliche Aspekte der Datenbereitstellung diskutiert, bevor die qualitativen Anforderungen an vertrauenswürdige Repositorien zur Bereitstellung von Forschungsdaten definiert werden. Ausführlich wird in der Folge auf pragmatische Aspekte der Datenbereitstellung eingegangen, etwa auf die Unterschiede zwischen Datenveröffentlichungen vom Typ 1 und Typ 2, auf Nutzungsembargos, auf die Definition des \"scientific use\" durch Nachnutzerinnen und -nutzer von veröffentlichten Daten sowie Empfehlungen zum Umgang mit etwaigen Konfliktfällen. Besonders hervorzuheben ist die neue Empfehlung unterschiedlicher Zugriffsklassen für die Bereitstellung von Daten mit unterschiedlichen datenschutzrechtlichen oder forschungsethischen Anforderungen. Diese reichen von komplett offenen Daten ohne Nutzungsbeschränkungen (\"Zugriffsklasse 0\") über an standardisierte Bedingungen (z.B. die Nachnutzung für rein wissenschaftliche Zwecke) geknüpfte Datenbereitstellung (\"Zugriffsklasse 1\") über individualisierte Nutzungsverträge (\"Zugriffsklasse 2\") bis hin zu einem gesicherten Datenzugriff, der nur unter streng kontrollierten Bedingungen (z.B. in einem Forschungsdatenzentrum) erfolgen kann (\"Zugriffsklasse 3\"). Die Umsetzung dieser wichtigen Neuerung ist jedoch geknüpft an technische Implementationen des Zugriffsklassenkonzeptes durch Datenrepositorien, die die entsprechenden Funktionalitäten bereitstellen. Zusammenfassend zielen die überarbeiteten Empfehlungen darauf ab, Forscherinnen und Forschern pragmatische Wege für den offenen und transparenten Umgang mit psychologischen Forschungsdaten aufzuzeigen und dabei auch strukturelle Herausforderungen eines für alle Beteiligten gewinnbringenden \"data sharings\" anzusprechen und entsprechende Maßnahmen vorzuschlagen.\n              \n            \n \n            \nPredicting affective appraisals from facial expressions and physiology using machine learningIsrael L & Schönbrodt F (2020).

A total of 134 features were extracted from the physiological data, and a benchmark comparing different kinds of machine learning algorithms was conducted to test how well the appraisal dimensions can be predicted from these features. For 13 out of 21 appraisals, a robust positive R2 was attained, indicating that the dimensions are actually related to the considered physiological channels. The highest R2 (.407) was reached for the appraisal dimension intrinsic pleasantness. Moreover, the comparison of linear and nonlinear algorithms and the inspection of the links between the appraisals and single physiological features using accumulated local effects plots indicates that the relationship between physiology and appraisals is nonlinear. By constructing different importance measures for the assessed physiological channels, we showed that for the 13 predictable appraisals, the five channels explained different amounts of variance and that only a few blocks incrementally explained variance beyond the other physiological channels.\n              \n            \n \n            \nMotivated behavior in intimate relationships: Comparing the predictive value of motivational variablesZygar‐Hoffmann C, Pusch S, Hagemeyer B & Schönbrodt F (2020).

We show that 1) compared to other summary statistics like the median, the mean of relationship satisfaction states describes retrospective and global evaluations best (but the difference to some other summary statistics was negligible); 2) retrospection introduces an overestimation of the average annoyance in the relationship reported on a momentary basis, which results in an overall negative mean-level bias for retrospective relationship satisfaction; 3) this bias is most strongly moderated by global relationship satisfaction at the time of retrospection; 4) snapshots of momentary relationship satisfaction get representative of global evaluations after approximately two weeks of sampling.

Dispositional needs, or motives, can differ between persons; however, little is known about their differential associations with everyday partner perception. The present study used data from a 4–week experience sampling study ( N = up to 60942 surveys from 510 individuals nested in 259 couples) to examine the effects of perceivers’ partner–related implicit and explicit communal motives on the perception of (i) global communal partner behaviour and (ii) specific communal and uncommunal partner behaviours. The results of truth and bias models of judgement and quasi–signal detection analyses indicate that strong implicit communal approach motives and strong explicit communal motives are associated with the tendency to overestimate the partner's communal behaviour. Additionally, strong implicit communal approach motives were associated with the tendency to avoid perceptions of uncommunal partner behaviour. Neither implicit nor explicit communal motives had an effect on accuracy in the perception of particularly communal partner behaviour. The results highlight the relevance of both implicit and explicit communal motives for momentary partner perceptions and emphasise the benefits of dyadic microlongitudinal designs for a better understanding of the mechanisms through which individual differences manifest in couples’ everyday lives. © 2019 The Authors.

Recent meta-analyses come to conflicting conclusions about the efficacy of long-term psychoanalytic psychotherapy (LTPP). Our first goal was to reproduce the most recent meta-analysis by Leichsenring, Abbass, Luyten, Hilsenroth, and Rabung (2013) who found evidence for the efficacy of LTPP in the treatment of complex mental disorders. Our replicated effect sizes were in general slightly smaller. Second, we conducted an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing LTPP (lasting for at least 1 year and 40 sessions) to other forms of psychotherapy in the treatment of complex mental disorders. We focused on a transparent research process according to open science standards and applied a series of elaborated meta-analytic procedures to test and control for publication bias. Our updated meta-analysis comprising 191 effect sizes from 14 eligible studies revealed small, statistically significant effect sizes at post-treatment for the outcome domains psychiatric symptoms, target problems, social functioning, and overall effectiveness (Hedges’ g ranging between 0.24 and 0.35). The effect size for the domain personality functioning (0.24) was not significant ( p = .08). No signs for publication bias could be detected. In light of a heterogeneous study set and some methodological shortcomings in the primary studies, these results should be interpreted cautiously. In conclusion, LTPP might be superior to other forms of psychotherapy in the treatment of complex mental disorders.

However, this process of clinical translation is challenging and time-consuming, and the standard route by which it proceeds is inefficient. Adaptive rolling designs, which originated within cancer treatment research, provide an alternative methodology with potential to accelerate development and optimization of psychological treatments. In such designs, multiple treatment options are tested simultaneously, with sequential Bayesian analyses used to remove poorly performing arms. Further, new treatment arms informed by the latest research findings can be introduced into the existing infrastructure as the trial progresses. These features dramatically reduce the sample sizes needed and offer a means for more rapid and efficient clinical translation. This article outlines the utility of such designs to clinical psychological science, focusing on a new variant termed the leapfrog design, and discusses their potential uses to accelerate clinical translation.\n              \n            \n \n            \nEmotion Prediction with Weighted Appraisal Models – Towards Validating a Psychological Theory of AffectIsrael L & Schönbrodt F (2019).

According to these theories, the subjective perception of an emotion results from a series of specific event evaluations. To validate and extend one of the most known representatives of appraisal theory, the Component Process Model by Klaus Scherer, we implemented four computational appraisal models that predicted emotion labels based on prototype similarity calculations. Different weighting algorithms, mapping the models' input to a distinct emotion label, were integrated in the models. We evaluated the plausibility of the models' structure by assessing their predictive power and comparing their performance to a baseline model and a highly predictive machine learning algorithm. Model parameters were estimated from empirical data and validated out-of-sample. All models were notably better than the baseline model and able to explain part of the variance in the emotion labels. The preferred model, yielding a relatively high performance and stable parameter estimations, was able to predict a correct emotion label with an accuracy of 40.2 percent and a correct emotion family with an accuracy of 76.9 percent. The weighting algorithm of this favored model corresponds to the weighting complexity implied by the Component Process Model, but uses differing weighting parameters.\n              \n            \n \n            \nAttitudes Toward Open Science and Public Data SharingAbele A, Gollwitzer M, Steinberg U & Schönbrodt F (2019).

Central values of science are, among others, transparency, verifiability, replicability, and openness. The currently very prominent Open Science (OS) movement supports these values. Among its most important principles are open methodology (comprehensive and useful documentation of methods and materials used), open access to published research output, and open data (making collected data available for re-analyses). We here present a survey conducted among members of the German Psychological Society ( N = 337), in which we applied a mixed-methods approach (quantitative and qualitative data) to assess attitudes toward OS in general and toward data sharing more specifically. Attitudes toward OS were distinguished into positive expectations (“hopes”) and negative expectations (“fears”). These were un-correlated. There were generally more hopes associated with OS and data sharing than fears. Both hopes and fears were highest among early career researchers and lowest among professors. The analysis of the open answers revealed that generally positive attitudes toward data sharing (especially sharing of data related to a published article) are somewhat diminished by cost/benefit considerations. The results are discussed with respect to individual researchers’ behavior and with respect to structural changes in the research system.\n              \n            \n \n            \nCorrecting for Bias in Psychology: A Comparison of Meta-Analytic MethodsCarter E, Schönbrodt F, Gervais W & Hilgard J (2019).

Methodologists have proposed a variety of statistical approaches to correct for such overestimation. However, it is not clear which methods work best for data typically seen in psychology. Here, we present a comprehensive simulation study in which we examined how some of the most promising meta-analytic methods perform on data that might realistically be produced by research in psychology. We simulated several levels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity, and used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature. Our results clearly indicated that no single meta-analytic method consistently outperformed all the others. Therefore, we recommend that meta-analysts in psychology focus on sensitivity analyses—that is, report on a variety of methods, consider the conditions under which these methods fail (as indicated by simulation studies such as ours), and then report how conclusions might change depending on which conditions are most plausible. Moreover, given the dependence of meta-analytic methods on untestable assumptions, we strongly recommend that researchers in psychology continue their efforts to improve the primary literature and conduct large-scale, preregistered replications.

This is done by estimating a polynomial regression model and using the graph of the model and several parameters as a guide to interpret the resulting regression coefficients in terms of the congruence hypothesis. One problem with using RSA in applied research is that the model and the interpretation of the model's parameters in terms of congruence effects have only been thoroughly developed for single-level data. Here, we present an extension of RSA to multilevel data. Among other things we show how the standard errors can be computed and how researchers can decide whether the occurrence of a congruence effect depends on a Level 2 covariate. We illustrate the suggested extension with 2 examples that guide readers through the test of congruence effects in the case of multilevel data. We also provide R scripts that researchers can adopt to conduct multilevel RSA.

Bayes Factor Design Analysis (BFDA) is a recently developed methodology that allows researchers to balance the informativeness and efficiency of their experiment (Schönbrodt & Wagenmakers, Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 25(1), 128-142 2018). With BFDA, researchers can control the rate of misleading evidence but, in addition, they can plan for a target strength of evidence. BFDA can be applied to fixed-N and sequential designs. In this tutorial paper, we provide an introduction to BFDA and analyze how the use of informed prior distributions affects the results of the BFDA. We also present a user-friendly web-based BFDA application that allows researchers to conduct BFDAs with ease. Two practical examples highlight how researchers can use a BFDA to plan for informative and efficient research designs.\n              \n            \n \n\n2018\n\n \n            \nThe Dominance, Prestige, and Leadership Account of Social Power MotivesSuessenbach F, Loughnan S, Schönbrodt F & Moore A (2018).

To overcome this problem, we developed and validated a unitary taxonomy of social power motives based on established delineations of social hierarchies: the dominance, prestige, and leadership account. While we could measure these motives both reliably and distinctively (study 1), we also showed they strongly related to a common power desire (study 2). Assessing their nomological networks (studies 3 and 4), we demonstrated distinct associations between the dominance motive (D: wanting to coerce others into adhering to one's will) and anger and verbal aggression; the prestige motive (P: wanting to obtain admiration and respect) and the fear of losing reputation and claiming to have higher moral concerns; the leadership motive (L: wanting to take responsibility in and for one's group) and emotional stability and helping behaviour. Furthermore, while D uniquely predicted agonistic/retaliatory behaviour in dictator games (study 5), L uniquely predicted the attainment of higher employment ranks in various professions (study 7). Finally, at least to some degree, P and L related positively, and D negatively to prosocial donating behaviour (study 6). This taxonomy represents a novel and powerful approach to predicting influential social behaviour. © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology\n              \n            \n \n            \nMany Labs 2: Investigating Variation in Replicability Across Samples and SettingsKlein R, Vianello M, Hasselman F, Adams B, Adams R, Alper S, Aveyard M, Axt J, Babalola M, Bahník Š, Batra R, Berkics M, Bernstein M, Berry D, Białobrzeska O, Binan E, Bocian K, Brandt M, Busching R, Rédei A, Cai H, Cambier F, Cantarero K, Carmichael C, Céric F, Chandler J, Chang J, Chatard A, Chen E, Cheong W, Cicero D, Coen S, Coleman J, Collisson B, Conway M, Corker K, Curran P, Cushman F, Dagona Z, Dalgar I, Rosa A, Davis W, Bruijn M, Schutter L, Devos T, Vries M, Doğulu C, Dozo N, Dukes K, Dunham Y, Durrheim K, Ebersole C, Edlund J, Eller A, English A, Finck C, Frankowska N, Freyre M, Friedman M, Galliani E, Gandi J, Ghoshal T, Giessner S, Gill T, Gnambs T, Gómez Á, González R, Graham J, Grahe J, Grahek I, Green E, Hai K, Haigh M, Haines E, Hall M, Heffernan M, Hicks J, Houdek P, Huntsinger J, Huynh H, IJzerman H, Inbar Y, Innes-Ker Å, Jiménez‐Leal W, John M, Joy-Gaba J, Kamiloglu R, Kappes H, Karabatı S, Karick H, Keller V, Kende A, Kervyn N, Knežević G, Kovacs C, Krueger L, Kurapov G, Kurtz J, Lakens D & Lazarević L (2018).

Each protocol was administered to approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305 participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the conventional criterion of statistical significance ( p &lt; .05), we found that 15 (54%) of the replications provided evidence of a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original finding. With a strict significance criterion ( p &lt; .0001), 14 (50%) of the replications still provided such evidence, a reflection of the extremely high-powered design. Seven (25%) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger than the original ones, and 21 (75%) yielded effect sizes smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen’s ds were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the replications. The effect sizes were small (&lt; 0.20) in 16 of the replications (57%), and 9 effects (32%) were in the direction opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings, the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39%) of the replication effects, and most of those were among the findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity. Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultures and less WEIRD cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low WEIRDness scores, respectively). Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied.\n              \n            \n \n            \nTesting Similarity Effects with Dyadic Response Surface AnalysisSchönbrodt F, Humberg S & Nestler S (2018).

Typically, these hypotheses have been investigated by using difference scores or other profile similarity indices as predictors of the outcome variables. These approaches, however, have been vigorously criticized for their conceptual and statistical shortcomings. Here, we introduce a statistical method that is based on polynomial regression and addresses most of these shortcomings: dyadic response surface analysis. This model is tailored for similarity effect hypotheses and fully accounts for the dyadic nature of relationship data. Furthermore, we provide a tutorial with an illustrative example and reproducible R and Mplus scripts that should assist substantive researchers in precisely formulating, testing, and interpreting their dyadic similarity effect hypotheses. © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology\n              \n            \n \n            \nMany Analysts, One Data Set: Making Transparent How Variations in Analytic Choices Affect ResultsSilberzahn R, Uhlmann E, Martin D, Anselmi P, Aust F, Awtrey E, Bahník Š, Bai F, Bannard C, Bonnier E, Carlsson R, Cheung F, Christensen G, Clay R, Craig M, Rosa A, Dam L, Evans M, Cervantes I, Fong N, Gamez-Djokic M, Glenz A, Gordon-McKeon S, Heaton T, Hederos K, Heene M, Mohr A, Högden F, Hui K, Johannesson M, Kalodimos J, Kaszubowski E, Kennedy D, Lei R, Lindsay T, Liverani S, Madan C, Molden D, Molleman E, Morey R, Mulder L, Nijstad B, Pope N, Pope B, Prenoveau J, Rink F, Robusto E, Roderique H, Sandberg A, Schlüter E, Schönbrodt F, Sherman M, Sommer S, Sotak K, Spain S, Spörlein C, Stafford T, Stefanutti L, Täuber S, Ullrich J, Vianello M, Wagenmakers E, Witkowiak M, Yoon S & Nosek B (2018).

Using data from 5 studies (laboratory and field, total N = 2,823), we used an information-theoretic approach combined with Response Surface Analysis to provide the first competitive test of 6 popular hypotheses: that more favorable self-perceptions are adaptive versus maladaptive (Hypotheses 1 and 2: Positivity of self-view hypotheses), that higher levels of self-enhancement (i.e., a higher discrepancy of self-viewed and objectively assessed ability) are adaptive versus maladaptive (Hypotheses 3 and 4: Self-enhancement hypotheses), that accurate self-perceptions are adaptive (Hypothesis 5: Self-knowledge hypothesis), and that a slight degree of self-enhancement is adaptive (Hypothesis 6: Optimal margin hypothesis). We considered self-perceptions and objective ability measures in two content domains (reasoning ability, vocabulary knowledge) and investigated 6 indicators of intra- and interpersonal psychological adjustment. Results showed that most adjustment indicators were best predicted by the positivity of self-perceptions. There were some specific self-enhancement effects, and evidence generally spoke against the self-knowledge and optimal margin hypotheses. Our results highlight the need for comprehensive and simultaneous tests of competing hypotheses. Implications for the understanding of underlying processes are discussed.

Within–subject processes are proposed to explain between–subject associations of dispositional motives and relationship satisfaction. For an empirical test of the model, data on the dispositional partner–related need for communion and global relationship satisfaction were obtained from 152 individuals in heterosexual relationships. In an extensive experience sampling spanning 2 weeks, a subsample of 130 individuals answered questions about their current motivational states, mood, state relationship satisfaction, and experiences with their partner five times a day. The results were largely consistent with the DynaMoS model: (1) individuals with a strong dispositional implicit communion motive reported more often to be in a communal motivational state; (2) communally motivated individuals were more likely to engage in subsequent instrumental behaviour; and (3) relationship experiences that potentially satisfy communion motivation led to more positive relationship outcomes when individuals were motivated before compared with when they were not. It is discussed how these results and the experience sampling method can foster our understanding of how dispositional characteristics translate into everyday processes and shape relationship outcomes.

Wo liegen strategische Vor- oder Nachteile? Gibt es „free rider“ oder „research parasites“ ( Longo & Drazen, 2016 ; McNutt, 2016 ), die mich ausnutzen? Wie kann ich mich in einem hart umkämpften Arbeitsmarkt gegen die Konkurrenz durchsetzen? Die aktuell vorliegenden Fragen beziehen sich zu einem großen Teil auf die zweite Perspektive. Das ist bei Nachwuchsforschenden legitim und nachvollziehbar. Uns ist es aber wichtig, bei allen Karriereunsicherheiten die übergeordnete Frage nicht zu vergessen: Wie können wir gute Wissenschaft umsetzen? Wie können wir dazu beitragen, dass echtes Wissen generiert wird? Das sollte uns als Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftlern das wichtigste Anliegen sein. Und entsprechend sollten wir als Fachgemeinschaft auch Karriereanreize so organisieren, dass sie dieses Ziel unterstützen.\n              \n            \n \n            \nRedefine statistical significanceBenjamin D, Berger J, Johannesson M, Nosek B, Wagenmakers E, Berk R, Bollen K, Brembs B, Brown L, Camerer C, Cesarini D, Chambers C, Clyde M, Cook T, Boeck P, Dienes Z, Dreber A, Easwaran K, Efferson C, Fehr E, Fidler F, Field A, Forster M, George E, Gonzalez R, Goodman S, Green E, Green D, Greenwald A, Hadfield J, Hedges L, Held L, Ho T, Hoijtink H, Hruschka D, Imai K, Imbens G, Ioannidis J, Jeon M, Jones J, Kirchler M, Laibson D, List J, Little R, Lupia A, Machery É, Maxwell S, McCarthy M, Moore D, Morgan S, Munafò M, Nakagawa S, Nyhan B, Parker T, Pericchi L, Perugini M, Rouder J, Rousseau J, Savalei V, Schönbrodt F, Sellke T, Sinclair B, Tingley D, Zandt T, Vazire S, Watts D, Winship C, Wolpert R, Xie Y, Young C, Zinman J & Johnson V (2017).

In this paper, we point out that part of this confusion is due to a lack of conceptual and methodological differentiation between effects of individual differences in how much people enhance themselves (SE) and in how positively they view themselves (positivity of self-view; PSV). We show that methods commonly used to analyze SE effects are biased because they cannot differentiate between the effects of PSV and the effects of SE. We provide a new condition-based regression analysis (CRA) that unequivocally identifies effects of SE by testing intuitive and mathematically derived conditions on the coefficients in a bivariate linear regression. Using data from 3 studies on intellectual SE (total N = 566), we then illustrate that the CRA provides novel results as compared with traditional methods. Results suggest that many previously identified SE effects are in fact effects of PSV alone. The new CRA approach thus provides a clear and unbiased understanding of the consequences of SE. It can be applied to all conceptualizations of SE and, more generally, to every context in which the effects of the discrepancy between 2 variables on a third variable are examined.

In contrast, there is almost no literature that discusses the design of experiments when Bayes factors (BFs) are used as a measure of evidence. Here we explore Bayes Factor Design Analysis (BFDA) as a useful tool to design studies for maximum efficiency and informativeness. We elaborate on three possible BF designs, (a) a fixed-n design, (b) an open-ended Sequential Bayes Factor (SBF) design, where researchers can test after each participant and can stop data collection whenever there is strong evidence for either $\\mathcal {H}_{1}$ or $\\mathcal {H}_{0}$ , and (c) a modified SBF design that defines a maximal sample size where data collection is stopped regardless of the current state of evidence. We demonstrate how the properties of each design (i.e., expected strength of evidence, expected sample size, expected probability of misleading evidence, expected probability of weak evidence) can be evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations and equip researchers with the necessary information to compute their own Bayesian design analyses.\n              \n            \n \n            \nA Bayesian bird's eye view of ‘Replications of important results in social psychology’Marsman M, Schönbrodt F, Morey R, Yao Y, Gelman A & Wagenmakers E (2017).

Soc. Psychol.45, 137-141. (doi:10.1027/1864-9335/a000192)). First, individual-experiment Bayesian parameter estimation revealed that for directed effect size measures, only three out of 44 central 95% credible intervals did not overlap with zero and fell in the expected direction. For undirected effect size measures, only four out of 59 credible intervals contained values greater than [Formula: see text] (10% of variance explained) and only 19 intervals contained values larger than [Formula: see text]. Second, a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis for all 38 t-tests showed that only one out of the 38 hierarchically estimated credible intervals did not overlap with zero and fell in the expected direction. Third, a Bayes factor hypothesis test was used to quantify the evidence for the null hypothesis against a default one-sided alternative. Only seven out of 60 Bayes factors indicated non-anecdotal support in favour of the alternative hypothesis ([Formula: see text]), whereas 51 Bayes factors indicated at least some support for the null hypothesis.

In diesem Beitrag zeigen wir Wege aus dieser Vertrauenskrise auf und beschreiben insbesondere individuelle Schritte hin zu verlässlichem und offenem Forschen: Verlässliches Forschen bezieht sich auf das Publizieren von robusten Ergebnissen, sowie von direkten und konzeptuellen Replikationsstudien und offenes Forschen auf die Transparenz hinsichtlich der Planung (Präregistrierung), der Durchführung (Open Material) und der Analyse (Open Data, Reproducible Code) wissenschaftlicher Untersuchungen. Das Bekenntnis zu verlässlicher und offener Forschung wird unser Handeln in den verschiedenen Rollen im Wissenschaftssystem (als Forscher, Reviewer, Herausgeber, Betreuer, Kommissionsmitglied etc.) verändern.

This study examined whether this restoration can be achieved by “presence,” the perceptual illusion of non-mediation. We suggest that the adoption of the mediated reference systems creates a “holiday from self” and restores self-control capacity. Depleted participants who saw an immersive video clip performed better in a subsequent self-control task than participants who saw a non-immersive video clip or were in a waiting group. But the concrete mechanism remains open: Self reported presence did not serve as a mediator.\n              \n            \n \n            \nTo Live Among Like-Minded OthersBleidorn W, Schönbrodt F, Gebauer J, Rentfrow P, Potter J & Gosling S (2016).

The present study explored the links between person-city personality fit and self-esteem. Using data from 543,934 residents of 860 U.S. cities, we examined the extent to which the fit between individuals’ Big Five personality traits and the Big Five traits of the city where they live (i.e., the prevalent traits of the city’s inhabitants) predicts individuals’ self-esteem. To provide a benchmark for these effects, we also estimated the degree to which the fit between person and city religiosity predicts individuals’ self-esteem. The results provided a nuanced picture of the effects of person-city personality fit on self-esteem: We found significant but small effects of fit on self-esteem only for openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, rather than effects for all Big Five traits. Similar results and effect sizes were observed for religiosity.

Open scientific practices such as sharing data, materials and analysis scripts alongside published articles have many benefits, including easier replication and extension studies, increased availability of data for theory-building and meta-analysis, and increased possibility of review and collaboration even after a paper has been published. Although modern information technology makes sharing easier than ever before, uptake of open practices had been slow. We suggest this might be in part due to a social dilemma arising from misaligned incentives and propose a specific, concrete mechanism—reviewers withholding comprehensive review—to achieve the goal of creating the expectation of open practices as a matter of scientific principle.\n              \n            \n \n\n2015\n\n \n            \nSequential hypothesis testing with Bayes factors: Efficiently testing mean differences.Schönbrodt F, Wagenmakers E, Zehetleitner M & Perugini M (2015).

Despite these criticisms, this research practice is not uncommon, probably because it appeals to researcher's intuition to collect more data to push an indecisive result into a decisive region. In this contribution, we investigate the properties of a procedure for Bayesian hypothesis testing that allows optional stopping with unlimited multiple testing, even after each participant. In this procedure, which we call Sequential Bayes Factors (SBFs), Bayes factors are computed until an a priori defined level of evidence is reached. This allows flexible sampling plans and is not dependent upon correct effect size guesses in an a priori power analysis. We investigated the long-term rate of misleading evidence, the average expected sample sizes, and the biasedness of effect size estimates when an SBF design is applied to a test of mean differences between 2 groups. Compared with optimal NHST, the SBF design typically needs 50% to 70% smaller samples to reach a conclusion about the presence of an effect, while having the same or lower long-term rate of wrong inference.

In this contribution, we tested the effect of four relevant parameters for IAT data that are the treatment of extreme latencies, the error treatment, the method for computing the IAT difference, and the distinction between practice and test critical trials. For some options of these different parameters, we included robust statistic methods that can provide viable alternative metrics to existing scoring algorithms, especially given the specificity of reaction time data. We thus elaborated 420 algorithms that result from the combination of all the different options and test the main effect of the four parameters with robust statistical analyses as well as their interaction with the type of IAT (i.e., with or without built-in penalty included in the IAT procedure). From the results, we can elaborate some recommendations. A treatment of extreme latencies is preferable but only if it consists in replacing rather than eliminating them. Errors contain important information and should not be discarded. The D score seems to be still a good way to compute the difference although the G score could be a good alternative, and finally it seems better to not compute the IAT difference separately for practice and test critical trials. From this recommendation, we propose to improve the traditional D scores with small yet effective modifications.\n              \n            \n \n            \nOpen Peer Commentary and Authors‘ ResponseNo authors indicated \n                Abstract\n             PDF\n\nCitation count: 11\n\nSmoking's steady creep - Time and change unravel slowly - Lifespan's subtle shift\n\n            \n              \n                ×\n                Abstract\n                Rauthmann, Sherman and Funder have made a landmark contribution to situation research in the target article of this issue.However, we propose that their work overlooks the need to incorporate a developmental perspective.This includes the separate but related issues of time and change.Situations often unfold over long periods of time, can bleed together, and are not time-delimited in the way traditional laboratory experiments define them.Moreover, individuals systematically change over time (lifespan development) and their reactions to situations, as well as their personality-situation transactions, develop in tandem.Rauthmann, Sherman & Funder have made a landmark contribution to situation research in their target article.After several decades marked by lack of consensus, the authors proffer a well-crafted case for consensual approval on key topics in situational research including three over-arching principles, many related corollaries, and several underlying operational definitions.We hope the article achieves the desired effect: provision of a solid and muchneeded foundation for the field.We propose however that the work of Rauthmann, Sherman & Funder overlooks the need to incorporate a developmental perspective, including the separate but related issues of time and change.To their credit, they do mention \"cumulative effects that accrue over time,\" intra-individual variation in situation experiences, temporality in situation ratings, and \"multi-time\" assessments of situations and persons.However, none of these directly acknowledges that situations often unfold over long periods of time, can bleed together, and are not time-delimited as traditionally defined by laboratory experiments.Additionally, individuals systematically change over the lifespan (development) with their reactions to situations developing in tandem.

As the behavior of 1 person has consequences that go beyond that individual, family functioning should be investigated in its full complexity. The social relations model (SRM; Kenny & La Voie, 1984) is a conceptual and analytical model that can disentangle family data from a round-robin design at 3 different levels: the individual level (actor and partner effects), the dyadic level (relationship effects), and the family level (family effect). Its statistical complexity may however be a hurdle for family researchers. The user-friendly R package fSRM performs almost automatically those rather complex SRM analyses and introduces new possibilities for assessing differences between SRM means and between SRM variances, both within and between groups of families. Using family data on negative processes, different type of research questions are formulated and corresponding analyses with fSRM are presented.\n              \n            \n \n            \nAffective contingencies in the affiliative domain: Physiological assessment, associations with the affiliation motive, and prediction of behavior.Dufner M, Arslan R, Hagemeyer B, Schönbrodt F & Denissen J (2015).

This propensity is considered a core process underlying the affiliation motive and a pervasive cause of motivated behavior. In this study, we tested these assumptions. We presented participants with positive affiliative stimuli and used electromyography to record changes in facial muscular activity that are indicative of subtle smiling. We were thus able to physiologically measure positive affect following affiliative cues. Individual differences in these affective contingencies were internally consistent and temporally stable. They converged with affiliation motive self- and informant reports and picture story exercise scores, indicating that they are partly accessible to the self, observable to outsiders, and overlap with implicit systems.

To make the most of this connection, researchers need to investigate possible moderators enhancing or reducing the extent of this attentional shifting. In this study we used a gaze cueing paradigm to demonstrate that the perceived trustworthiness of a cueing person constitutes such a moderator for female participants. Our results show a significant interaction between perceived trustworthiness and the response time trade-off between valid and invalid gaze cues [gaze cueing effect (GCE)], as manifested in greater following of a person's gaze if this person was trustworthy as opposed to the following of an untrustworthy person's gaze. An additional exploratory analysis showed potentially moderating influences of trait-anxiety on this interaction (p = .057). The affective background of the experiment (i.e., using positive or negative target stimuli) had no influence.Keywords: Affective backgroundAnxietyGaze cueingModeratorTrustworthiness Supplementary materialSupplementary content is available via the 'Supplementary' tab on the article's online page (http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20445911.2014.945457).Notes1 This requirement was due to an additional hypothesis in which we predicted that two familiar faces (Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings and Hannibal Lecter from The Silence of the Lambs) would be naturally and more strongly primed trustworthy or untrustworthy, respectively, and thus participants should show an even bigger difference in GCEs when following – or not following – the gaze of these faces. As we had problems finding enough participants who had seen both movies and as this was just an additional exploratory hypothesis, we relaxed this requirement. Thus, we ended up with 48 out of 60 participants who had seen both movies. However, results regarding these characters are not reported here, as they can only be regarded exploratory since these character's faces could neither be counterbalanced with their corresponding trustworthiness nor could we efficiently control for effects of different degrees of familiarity, which might have had an effect (Deaner et al., Citation2007). Nonetheless, the interested reader finds all the obtained results and our complete dataset in the online supplementary material.\n              \n            \n \n            \nLoneliness and social behaviours in a virtual social environmentLuhmann M, Schönbrodt F, Hawkley L & Cacioppo J (2014).

In this study, we examined the behavioural consequences of loneliness in a virtual social environment. A total of 176 participants navigated a character (protagonist) through a two-dimensional browser game and rated the character's loneliness multiple times during the game. In the first part of the game, another character is introduced as the protagonist's spouse. At one point, the spouse leaves for an undetermined period of time but later returns. Immediately before this separation, higher ascribed loneliness of the protagonist was associated with more frequent interactions with the spouse. After the reunion, however, higher ascribed loneliness was associated with less frequent interactions with the spouse. Ascribed loneliness was not significantly related to the frequency of interactions with others nor to the frequency of solitary activities. These patterns held after controlling for ascribed positive affect. Participants' levels of loneliness were related to the level of ascribed loneliness only when the spouse was present but not when the spouse was absent. In sum, these findings suggest that the conditions that trigger the vicious cycle of loneliness are person- and situation-specific.\n              \n            \n \n            \nValidation of direct and indirect measures of preference for sexualized violence.Larue D, Schmidt A, Imhoff R, Eggers K, Schönbrodt F & Banse R (2014).

Participants from a community sample (N = 422; mean age = 29 years; mean relationship duration = 4.8 years) encountered three attachment-related key scenes in a VSE: a separation with a subsequent reunion, a conflict, and an illness. In these scenarios, participants gave instructions to the main character (the \"protagonist\"), who had a romantic relationship with one of the other agents (the \"virtual spouse\"). Recorded were numerous behaviors as well as emotions participants ascribed to the protagonist. Generally, participants' attachment styles correlated as predicted with their behavior toward the virtual spouse, with βs up to.42. Thus, the study demonstrates that internal working models are transferred to the virtual relationship. This approach opens new ways to investigate attachment-related behavior by using VSEs that allow experimental variations of the virtual partner's reactions and other situational variables.\n              \n            \n \n            \nPERSOC: A Unified Framework for Understanding the Dynamic Interplay of Personality and Social RelationshipsBack M, Baumert A, Denissen J, Hartung F, Penke L, Schmukle S, Schönbrodt F, Schröder–Abé M, Vollmann M, Wagner J & Wrzus C (2011).

Here, we present an integrative and unified framework for analysing the complex dynamics of personality and social relationships (PERSOC). Basic principles and general processes on the individual and dyadic level are outlined to show how personality and social relationships influence each other and develop over time. PERSOC stresses the importance of social behaviours and interpersonal perceptions as mediating processes organized in social interaction units. The framework can be applied to diverse social relationships such as first encounters, short–term acquaintances, friendships, relationships between working group members, educational or therapeutic settings, romantic relationships and family relationships. It has important consequences for how we conceptualize, understand, and investigate personality and social relationships.

One major current topic in agent design consequently is to enhance their believability, often by incorporating internal models of emotions or motivations. As psychological theories often lack the necessary details for direct implementation, many agent modelers currently rely on models that are rather marginal in current psychological research, or models that are created ad hoc with little theoretical and empirical foundation. The goal of this article is both to raise psychologists’ awareness of the central challenges in the process of creating psychologically believable agents, and to recommend existing psychological frameworks to the virtual agents community that seem particularly useful for implementation in ECAs. Special attention is paid to a computationally detailed model of basic social motives that seems particularly useful for implementation: the Zurich model of social motivation.\n              \n            \n \n\n2010\n\n \n            \nAntecedents and Consequences of Peer–Rated IntelligenceDenissen J, Schönbrodt F, Zalk M, Meeus W & Aken M (2010).

Results indicated that peer–reputations of intelligence were reliable, stable and weakly correlated with objective intelligence. Bias was shown by correlations with interpersonal liking (decreasing across time) and idiosyncratic rating tendencies (increasing across time). Agreement between self–ratings and peer–reputations increased over time but was not based on increasing accuracy but on reciprocal associations between self–ratings and peer–reputations in the beginning of the acquaintanceship process, and on peer–reputations predicting changes in self–ratings later on. Finally, it was shown that peer–rated intelligence reputations predict academic achievement across two 4–month periods (even when tested intelligence was controlled) and dropout from university after 8 months. Overall, the pattern of results demonstrates the utility of a socioanalytic perspective in analysing personality and social processes. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
