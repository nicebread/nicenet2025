  abstract: "<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"openProjectModal('From local to systemic implementation: Embedding open research in institutional practices', 'At least 50% of global research is not replicable, undermining trust in scientific results and slowing down innovation. Implementing Open Research Practices (ORPs) has proven to be a suitable strategy to increase the reliability and reproducibility of research which is a necessary condition for innovative capacity.<br>While technological barriers and policies for ORPs have been relatively well-addressed, the adoption of these practices by researchers is still limited. The LMU Open Science Center proposes to address this implementation gap with novel programmes that focus on two key remaining barriers to adoption: lack of training for researchers in their daily workflows and absence of community building to establish norms and provide support during this transition. <br>The \\'switch-to-open\\' program is an innovative intervention designed to help individual research groups transition from closed to open workflows. After consulting research groups, we will provide them with tailored (self)-learning resources and design together with them an optimal workflow for their research. Together, we will write an open research practice guide to be used as an onboarding document for new team members. This will also be used as a starting point for other groups in the same department. For each group, the program will end with a departmental seminar to raise awareness and inspire wider adoption.  <br>The complementary train-the-trainer program focuses on empowering participants to become instructors of ORPs to increase uptake within their disciplines. It covers eight modules, including knowledge on the replicability crisis, statistical knowledge, computational reproducibility, pre-analysis planning, FAIR data sharing, publication sharing, replication and meta-research, and academic culture. The content is currently mapped out for quantitative sciences, with plans to expand to the humanities. Participants will also receive training in pedagogy, ambassadorship, and leadership skills. Training materials will be used in the switch-to-open program and reused by future instructors in their workshops.  <br>These programmes are designed to systematically create local environments which are conducive to behavioural change so as to promote the widespread adoption of ORPs and achieve systemic change at the university level.  <br>Both programs will be developed, implemented, and evaluated over a period of three years, with two dedicated scientific coordinators with high expertise in open research. The switch-to-open program aims to switch approximately 10 research groups, while the train-the-trainer program aims to train around 50 instructors, which in turn will train 250 further participants within the funding period (and more after the funding period).  <br>We will ensure the project‚Äôs impact and consolidation through curated networking forums between our programme participants and coordinated local actions with faculty management to further embed ORPs within institutional practices. We will also promote the replication of our programmes by other organisations by sharing our lessons learned and materials through our networks, peer-reviewed articles, and a one day conference.'); return false;\">üîç Abstract</a>"

  abstract: "<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"openProjectModal('Agile-RDM - Establishing an agile and needs-oriented research data management strategy in psychology', 'Transparency and openness in the research process are becoming increasingly important in all scientific fields - including psychology. Accordingly, researchers should not only make research results freely available, for example in the form of scientific articles (open access), but also provide research data, analysis scripts and study materials that are relevant for the replicability of the findings. However, the reusability of the data made available requires the most uniform, efficient and comprehensive research data management (RDM) possible on the part of the data providers: Research data should not only be findable (Findable) and accessible (Accessible), but also usable (Interoperable and Reusable) (cf. the FAIR principles). Despite a variety of training measures, the effort required to prepare data for sharing is often still perceived as very high, as it is often very difficult to translate and integrate the acquired knowledge into concrete workflows. In our view, this is because existing strategies to promote RDM skills are often too generic to address the specific needs of individual researchers. Furthermore, little effort is made to ensure the sustainability of the acquired skills or to resort to didactic-methodological approaches that enable an easy transfer of the acquired knowledge into the researchers\\' workflows. With the project \\'Agile-RDM: Establishing an agile and needs-oriented research data management strategy in psychology\\', we aim to develop such a strategy for psychology and establish it in the discipline. To this end, three strategic goals are pursued: 1) The development of an agile and needs-oriented RDM certificate course for researchers in psychology; 2) an empirical evaluation of the agile certificate course to assess its suitability for the effective and efficient teaching of RDM competencies; 3) the development and evaluation of a concept for project-related incentive structures that will ensure the implementation of the RDM practices learned in the certificate course in research projects in the long term.'); return false;\">üîç Abstract</a>"

  abstract: "<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"openProjectModal('Experimental investigation of the daily motivational processes in intimate relationships using ecological momentary interventions', 'The goal of this research project is a consistent continuation of the DFG project ‚ÄúDynamics of implicit motives in intimate couple relationships‚Äù, which showed the importance of motives for short-term motivation- and regulation processes in couple relationships: Motive dispositions orient, select and energize behavior towards the attainment of specific goals via motivational states. The experienced affect when reaching the desired goal state depends on the currently experienced motivational state (affect amplification by motivation), a process path that might explain the associations between motive dispositions and relationship quality. This functional, dynamic mode of action of motive dispositions, mediated by the current motivation, is the content of the ‚ÄúDynamics of Motive Satisfaction‚Äù (DynaMoS) model, which was correlatively confirmed in the previous project by micro-longitudinal analyses for partner-related communal motives. The research project builds on these findings and addresses the fundamental question of the causality of the process paths of the DynaMoS model by testing the functional mode of action of the postulated mechanisms with the help of smartphone-based experimental microinterventions in the everyday life of couples (‚Äúecological momentary interventions‚Äù). It will focus on comprehensively understanding the motivational system within the communal motive domain. In addition to considering the temporal component of the process, the manifestations of relationship-specific behavior and affect will be collected multimodally: Specific self and partner reports in experience sampling will be complemented by unobtrusive mobile sensing and content analysis of text messages. With this project we follow the collective call of a large number of researchers to fulfill the current desiderata of a future-oriented personality research: (a) to investigate the joint interplay of motivational, affective, and cognitive processes, (b) to link the microlevel of dynamic intrapersonal processes with the macrolevel of interindividual differences, and (c) to consider the causality of intrapersonal processes, especially those processes that act as a link between personality traits and social outcomes. Additionally, the causal approach to motivational microdynamics in intimate relationships and the natural assessment in everyday life provides an informed basis for the development of evidence-based interventions in (couple-)therapeutic contexts, suitable for everyday use. In addition to a better understanding of motivational processes in intimate relationships, the project makes an important contribution to the integration of psychological personality, motivation, and relationship research, as well as applied practice.'); return false;\">üîç Abstract</a>"

  abstract: "<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"openProjectModal('How an academic system can achieve a trustworthy knowledge base: Analyzing reform proposals in an agent-based modeling approach (part of the META-REP priority program, 1st funding phase)', 'In several scientific fields, evidence has accumulated that the scientific literature is much less robust and trustworthy than desired, constituting a ‚Äúreplication crisis‚Äù. Many reforms have been proposed to increase the trustworthiness of the scientific literature, but reasonable doubts have been raised about their effectiveness, fairness, potential side-effects, and evidentiary backing. In this project, we will formalize recent arguments and reform proposals, and build agent-based models of science (where researchers are the agents) to investigate the logical coherence, efficiency, and side- effects of reforms. The models will be empirically calibrated to three disciplines from the behavioral, social, and cognitive sciences. Three specific research questions investigate the impact of reform proposals on the trustworthiness and bandwidth of scientific output: (a) Open Science as a social dilemma, or: The evolution of transparency, (b) Registered reports and a multi-layered publication system, and (c) Assessing strategies for navigating epistemic landscapes: The role of replication and theory. In a final working package (d), we aim to combine the three submodels into an integrated model. This will be used to analyze potential interactions of reforms, optimal parameter configurations, and emergent patterns arising from the interactions of the agents. We expect that the insights of this research project can inform policy development, such as journal guidelines, hiring policies of academic institutions and other incentive structures, or funder‚Äôs resource allocation strategies. Furthermore, it informs how to maximize the informational gain of scientific results, which ultimately translates to the societal utility of research.'); return false;\">üîç Abstract</a>"

ABMs, which create virtual, simplified representations of real-world environments for computational simulation, are valuable tools in studying these processes. In the first funding phase of this project, ABMs addressed various meta-scientific questions, focusing on individual activities related to the production of academic works, such as replication studies, record checking and correction, and p-hacking. The second funding phase will expand on this work by targeting structural and institutional aspects of academia and related reform proposals, expanding the focus from ‚Äúacademic works‚Äù towards ‚Äúworking in academia‚Äù. The project will implement the demographics of virtual researchers and include population and labour dynamics in the ABMs. By that, the project will concentrate on researchers as human beings and analyse how structural reforms affect their life trajectories and productivity. The second funding phase consists of three major areas of study: 1. Research evaluation: Examining how changes in incentives and assessment practices impact researchers‚Äô life trajectories and, subsequently, the quality of the literature. 2. Differential value of early and late interventions: Assessing the effectiveness of interventions aimed at increasing researchers‚Äô capabilities and, consequently, the quality of their output, compared to post-hoc error control. 3. Institutional career conditions and constraints: Analysing the impact of contractual and legal constraints on researchers and their output. The project will use several ABMs, which are calibrated to reality by a multitude of empirical data, and conduct one empirical evaluation study of an innovative training programme (the ‚Äúswitch-to-open‚Äù programme for academic working groups) to generate actionable input to policy recommendations. The insights from this project will contribute to ongoing debates about academia.

  abstract: "<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"openProjectModal('The dynamics of implicit motives in close relationships', 'The research project aims at an extensive examination of the relevance of implicit motives for (a) long-term developmental trajectories and (b) short-term regulatory processes in intimate couple relationships. Implicit motives are defined as dispositional needs which, despite their non-conscious representation, energize and direct subjective experience and behavior towards specific classes of affectively valued goal states. In the domain of couple relationships, such goal states can be classified as communal (i.e., related to intimacy and closeness with one‚Äôs partner) or agentic (i.e., related to independence, mastery, and dominance). Communal and agentic motives are distinct need dimensions which have been shown to be valid predictors of relationship quality in cross-sectional and prospective studies. However, longitudinal studies with repeated motive assessments that allow for analyses of the dynamic transactions between motives and couple relationships are missing. Moreover, the motivational processes and mechanisms that underly the observed associations between motives and relationships are largely unknown. The proposed research project aims to fill these gaps in our knowledge about the role of motives in couple relationships. First, we intend to assess implicit motives in a subsample of the pairfam panel study three times in time intervals of one year. This design allows for (a) the prediction of long-term developmental trajectories in couple relationships and (b) analyses of the dynamic transactions between relationships and implicit motives. Second, we intend to implement an extensive experience sampling study to investigate (a) individual short-term processes of motivation and (b) dyadic patterns of coregulation that mediate the influences of implicit motives on couple relationships.'); return false;\">üîç Abstract</a>"

  abstract: "<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"openProjectModal('Automatic classification of the emotional impact of video sequences', 'The concept Quality of Experience (QoE) tries to assess the subjective quality which an observer experiences when consuming multimedia content. In the current proposal, QoE should be extended by a new central component, namely the emotional state an observer experiences when watching a video. The core of our project is to extract emotionally relevant key features if videos using several machine learning approaches, which in turn are used to predict the experienced emotion of the observer. In order to realize this interdisciplinary research question technically, we draw upon and extend psychological models of emotion, which are then computationally implemented by engineers. Supervised machine learning approaches are trained by comparing the predicted with the actual emotional experience of an observer. This learning stage will use a Crowd Sourcing approach which allows to gather a large amount of data for relatively low costs. The large sample allows a broad generalizability of the results, and allows to investigate how personality characteristics of the observers modulate the emotional impact of the videos. The results from the online study will be cross-validated and extended in a controlled laboratory experiment. In this study, objective and indirect indicators of the experienced emotions are assessed (electromyography of facial expressions; changes in skin conductance). The interdisciplinary project is composed of researchers from psychology and computer engineers and works on the following research questions: a) Is it possible to determine a mapping of technical features onto emotionally relevant stimuli? b) Are psychological models able to correctly predict the experienced emotions based on relevant stimuli of the video and personality features of a person? Goals of the project are, on the one hand, to implement existing psychological theories of emotion, validate them using large data sets, and to develop them further based on these results. On the other hand, the technical framework should be employed to classify a large set of videos concerning the emotional impact on observers. Furthermore, the project will generate a standardized data base of videos, for which the emotional impact is very well known. We expect that such a data base will have a huge impact and benefit for future studies in the area of human emotions.'); return false;\">üîç Abstract</a>"
